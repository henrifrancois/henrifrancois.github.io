Hi, I'm Henri. I have been coding for nine years now, and currently work in the chips industry on networking firmware and applications.
I am originally from Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and am passionate about creating computing solutions which can provide value for anyone, particularly those with limited means and access. During my time in undergrad, I focused on research on energy systems, but have also always worked on projects related to systems programming and web development.

I am a long time writer of Python, but over the last three years have been enjoying writing more and more Rust. In my current work, I rotate between C, C++ and C#, with sprinkles of Python and Rust here and there.

I am always looking to connect and learn more about like-minded individuals. If you'd like to reach out, please don't hesitate to find me on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@henrif), or shoot me an email at <henrifrancois97@gmail.com>.

Henri
