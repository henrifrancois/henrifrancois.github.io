Hi, I'm Henri. I have been coding for eight years now, and have recently graduated with my BS in Computer Science.
I am originally from Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and am passionate about creating computing solutions which can provide value for anyone, particularly those with limited means and access. During my time in undergrad, I focused on research on energy systems, but have also always worked on projects related to systems programming and web development.

I am a long time writer of Python, but over the last three years have been enjoying writing more and more Rust. Currently, I am interested in learning more about Compiler Design, when I can.

I am always looking to connect and learn more about like-minded individuals. If you'd like to reach out, please don't hesitate to tweet at me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/henri_franc), or shoot me an email at <henri.francois@protonmail.com>.

Henri
